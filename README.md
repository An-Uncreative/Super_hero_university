After the covid pandemic, individuals with powers emerged. Chaos ensued, and in-order to return order to the general populace, The United Nations decided to establish institutions around the world to help tutor the gifted, and enable them to use their powers for good. G2 university was the institution established in my country, and for the past two years the institution has continued to grow actively. This is a website for the G2 university of the gifted.
